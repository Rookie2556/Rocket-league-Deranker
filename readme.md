This is just a small python program I worked on randomly.

The purpose of this program is to allow one to derank through ranks in rocket league. I wanted to play with my little brother but he's too low and I'm too high ranked.

This bot basically just presses random buttons, for a random inteval while showing the user what is being pressed and how long the programs been running etc.
QWEASD are defaults, and T M will require reassignment. Disable chat typing or clear keybinds for T.

For this to work, the Rocket league must be windowed and at least touching the top left or kept in focus. I could watch netflix on the other half of the screen and use the
top left for RL, and the bottom left for the banner. If user has more than one monitor, put Rocket league on the main, and put something that doesn't need focus e.g. Netflix
on another screen.

Unfortunately at the time of writing this, Python *Does not* support inactive window interaction and so the rocket league window has to be active .
